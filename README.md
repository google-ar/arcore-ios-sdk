## Additional Terms

You must disclose the use of ARCore, and how it collects and processes data.
This can be done by displaying a prominent link to the site "How Google uses
data when you use our partners' sites or apps", (located at
www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/, or any other URL Google may provide

## Deprecation policy

Apps built with **ARCore SDK 1.12.0 or higher** are covered by the
[Cloud Anchor API deprecation policy](//developers.google.com/ar/distribute/deprecation-policy).

Apps built with **ARCore SDK 1.11.0 or lower** will be unable to host or resolve
Cloud Anchors beginning December 2020 due to the SDK's use of an older,
deprecated ARCore Cloud Anchor service.
