## Deprecation policy

Apps built with **ARCore SDK 1.12.0 or higher** are covered by the
[Cloud Anchor API deprecation policy](//developers.google.com/ar/distribute/deprecation-policy).

Apps built with **ARCore SDK 1.11.0 or lower** will be unable to host or resolve
Cloud Anchors beginning December 2020 due to the SDK's use of an older,
deprecated ARCore Cloud Anchor service.
